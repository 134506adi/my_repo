CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and enhance websites. It controls how HTML elements—such as text, images, and buttons—are displayed on a webpage. With CSS, you can adjust font sizes and colors, add backgrounds, and manage the layout, transforming a basic webpage into a visually appealing and user-friendly experience. CSS also simplifies layout management across multiple web pages by using external stylesheets stored in CSS files.
